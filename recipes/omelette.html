    <h3>Good ol' omelette!</h3>
    <p>Everyone has heard of this one, who doesn't like eggs?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp sunflower oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beaten eggs well with salt and pepper. Heat the oil and butter 
            in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat until the butter has melted and is foaming.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs into the pan, tilt the pan ever so slightly from one side to another to 
            allow the eggs to swirl and cover the surface of the pan completely. Let the mixture cook 
            for about 20 seconds then scrape a line through the middle with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Tilt the pan again to allow it to fill back up with the runny egg. Repeat once or 
            twice more until the egg has just set.</li>
        <li>At this point you can fill the omelette with whatever you like – some grated cheese, 
            sliced ham, fresh herbs, sautéed mushrooms or smoked salmon all work well. Scatter 
            the filling over the top of the omelette and fold gently in half with the spatula. Slide 
            onto a plate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
