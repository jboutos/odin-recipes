   <h3>Mousakas is one of the most popular Greek dishes</h3>
   <p>Mousakas is a multi-layered dish. The first layer consists of fried or 
    grilled veggies at the bottom. On top of it goes the bolognese sauce followed

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>To prepare this Greek moussaka recipe, begin by preparing the eggplants.
             Remove the stalks from the eggplants and cut them into slices, 1 cm thick. 
             Season with salt and place in a colander for about half an hour.
    </li>
    <li>Rinse the eggplants with plenty of water and squeeze with your hands, to get rid of 
        the excessive water. Pat them dry and fry in plenty of oil, until nicely colored. 
        Place the fried eggplants on some paper, in order to absorb the oil. 
        (For a lighter version of the traditional Greek moussaka try drizzling the 
        aubergines with some olive oil and bake them for 20 minutes instead of frying them). 
        Set aside when done.
    </li>
    <li>If you are adding potatoes to your moussaka, now its time to slice them into 0.5cm,
         half a finger width slices. Fry them or bake them in the same way as the eggplants. 
         Season with some salt and set them aside when done.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare the meat sauce for the moussaka. Heat a large pan to medium-high heat and 
        add the olive oil. Stir in the chopped onions and sauté, until softened and slightly 
        colored. Stir in the mince breaking it up with a wooden spoon and sauté. When it starts 
        to brown, add the the garlic and tomato paste and sauté until the garlic starts to soften. 
        Pour in the red wine to deglaze the meat juices and wait to evaporate. Add the tinned 
        tomatoes, the sugar, a pinch of cinnamon, 1 bay leaf, the cloves and a good pinch of 
        salt and pepper. Bring to the boil then turn the heat down and simmer with the lid on 
        for about 30 minutes or until most of the juices have evaporated. Set aside when done.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare the béchamel sauce for the moussaka. Use a large pan to melt the butter over low-medium heat.
         Add the flour whisking continuously to make a paste. Add warmed milk in a steady stream; 
         keep whisking in order to prevent your sauce from getting lumpy. If the sauce still needs 
         to thicken, boil over low heat while continuing to stir. Its consistency should resemble a 
         thick cream.Prepare the béchamel sauce for the moussaka. Use a large pan to melt the butter

           should resemble a thick cream.</li>
    <li>Remove the béchamel pan from the stove and stir in the egg yolks, salt, pepper, 
        a pinch of nutmeg and the most of the grated cheese. Reserve some cheese to sprinkle 
        on top! Whisk quickly, in order to prevent the eggs from turning an omelette!  
        Season with salt to taste. Take one spoon full of béchamel and stir it in the meat sauce. 
        Set the béchamel sauce aside.
    </li>
    <li>Now it’s time to assemble the moussaka. For this moussaka recipe you will need a large 
        baking dish, approx. 20x30cm / 8x12inch and 8cm/3 inch deep). Butter the bottom and sides 
        of the pan and layer the potatoes first (if you’re using them), then half the eggplants. 
        Pour in all of the meat sauce and spread it out evenly. Don’t forget to remove the cloves 
        and the bay leaf!. Add a second layer of eggplants, top with all of the béchamel sauce and 
        smooth out with a spatula.

    </li>
    <li>Sprinkle with the remaining grated cheese. Preheat you oven at 180C/350F and bake your
         musaka for about 60 minutes or until its crust turns light golden brown. Even though 
         it will be really hard to do so, you should wait for the moussaka to cool down and be
          just warm to the touch before cutting into pieces. This will prevent the béchamel sauce 
          from pouring out when you’re cutting your pieces.
