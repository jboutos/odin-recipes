    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons evoo</li>
        <li>Dried oregano</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the olive oil in a skillet. In medium heat, add the chopped garlic and 
            sauté for 1-2 minutes. Add the chopped tomatoes. Season with sea salt and sprinkle 
            all over one tablespoon of dried oregano.Stir tomatoes and cook for 5-6 minutes, 
            occasionally stirring. Don't break the tomatoes too much.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs and add them to the skillet. Cook eggs to your desired texture. While cooking, 
            stir a couple of times but don't overdo it. Serve immediately with crumbled feta cheese, 
            some fresh oregano leaves (optional), and a sprinkle of chili flakes—drizzle a bit of extra 
            virgin olive oil if you like.</li>
